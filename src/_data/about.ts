  Hey! I'm Bartosz Jarocki and I live in Wrocław, Poland. I grew up in a small town Góra. 
  I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Control systems engineering and Robotics at the Wrocław University of Technology. 
  I like bikes, books, plants, programming, and traveling the world with my wonderful wife Kasia. 
  Also, I’m fascinated by the cosmos and I find great pleasure in watching stars.
