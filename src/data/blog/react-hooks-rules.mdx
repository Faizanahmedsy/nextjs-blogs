When React introduced Hooks I was a bit skeptical. I was used to all the lifecycle methods and it felt natural.
On the other hand, I knew I fixed (and introduced myself) countless number of bugs related to the wrong implementation of `componentDidUpdate`
like having stale data, fetching data for wrong props, updating/recreating unnecessary objects and many more.
React Hooks and the way they work force you to change the way you think about components. Previously it was
about finding the right component lifecycle method, now it's when and why you want to do particular side effects.
Here are the things I've learned past few months which I think are important to know about using Hooks.

1. **Always** use [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks). 
  It will point you most common errors like using wrong dependencies, calling Hooks inside conditionals, loops or nested functions.

2. This might seem obvious but remember to only use Hooks in React function components and custom Hooks. You **can not** use Hooks in class components.

3. Do not use a single state variable for all you state data. Try to group them based on what data change together.
  The `useState` hook replaces the state value every time you call `setState`, not merges it (it does in a class component!).

    ```js
    function MyComponent() {
      const [state, setState] = useState({
        someState: null,
        otherState: "initial value",
      })
      // ...

      // ðŸ”´ there's no `otherState` anymore!
      setState({ someState: "new value" })
    }
    ```

    The recommended way is to split all you state data into a separate state like this

    ```js
    function MyComponent() {
      const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(null)
      const [otherState, setOtherstate] = useState("initial value")
      // ...

      // âœ… otherState remains untouched
      setSomeState("new value") 
    }
    ```

    If you really want to use one state variable for some reason you can do the following

    ```js
    function MyComponent() {
      const [state, setState] = useState({
        someState: null,
        otherState: "initial value",
      })
      // ...

      // âœ… otherState remains untouched too
      setState(state => ({ ...state, someState: "new value" })) 
    }
    ```

    or... create a custom Hook which will manage complex state for you.

4. Instead of trying to mimic lifecycle method, think - with which state (by state here I mean everything - state, props, functions, and any other data) this effect synchronize with?

    ```js
    function MyComponent() {
      // âœ… syncs with ALL the state - runs EVERY render
      useEffect(() => {
      // do something
      }) 
    }
    ```

    ```js
    function MyComponent() {
      // âœ… syncs with NO the state - runs ONCE after rendering
      useEffect(() => {
      // do something
      }, [])
    }
    ```

    ```js
    function MyComponent({ myProp }) {
      const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(null)

      // âœ… syncs with myProp and someState - it'll be run every time one of them changes
      useEffect(() => {
      // do something
      }, [myProp, someState])
    }
    ```

5. Be careful when you specify dependencies of `useEffect`, they're compared using `Object.is()`

    ```js
    function MyComponent() {
      const someObject = {
        prop: "test",
      }

      // ðŸ”´ it'll run EVERY render! someObject is different on every render in terms of reference!
      useEffect(() => {
      // do something
      }, [someObject])
    }
    ```

    it's because when you run the following

    ```js
    const someObject = {
      prop: "test",
    }
    const verySomeObject = {
      prop: "test",
    }
    Object.is(someObject, verySomeObject)
    ```

    the result will be `false`. To avoid this you can either make sure objects are recreated only when they actually change, make them a state or use
    a custom hook which would do a deep comparison.

6. Remember to clean up an effect - unsubscribe from a data source, clear intervals, stop stream or whatever might be still running after effect is done.
 It is achieved by providing a return function to your effect.

    ```js
    function MyComponent({ id }) {
      useEffect(() => {
        const subscription = DataSource.subscribe(id)

        return () => {
          subscription.unsubscribe();
        };
      }, [id]);
    }
    ```

7. **Do not** use `async` function as `useEffect` param. With the following implementation

    ```js
    function MyComponent() {
      useEffect(async () => {
      /* ... */
      });
    }
    ```

    you'll get 
    > Warning: useEffect function must return a cleanup function or nothing. Promises and useEffect(async () => â€¦) are not supported, but you can call an async function inside an effect

    it's because `async` function returns an implicit promise and `useEffect` expects `cleanup function or nothing`. Instead, you should do this

    ```js
    function MyComponent() {
      useEffect(() => {
        const asyncOperation = async () => { /* .... */ }

        asyncOperation()
      });
    }
    ```

8. If you're missing `PureComponent`, `shouldComponentUpdate` and want to optimize your function component, `React.memo` will be what you are looking for.

There's probably more but all of the above happened to me. I understand if you think this might sound overwhelming but now I can say that without any doubts - **Hooks allow creating less error-prone and better-designed components with less code.**
