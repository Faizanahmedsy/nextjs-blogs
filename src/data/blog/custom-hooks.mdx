Recently I was playing with MediaStream API. It turned out, it was a great time to play with React Hooks.
Let's create a simple React component which displays a stream from your computer camera. And by the way, this post assumes
you have a basic understanding of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/hooks).

```js
import React from "react"

export const Stream = ({ className, stream }) => {
  const setVideoRef = videoElement => {
    if (videoElement) {
      videoElement.srcObject = stream
    }
  }

  return <video className={className} autoPlay={true} ref={setVideoRef} />
}
```

Nothing really to describe here, it's just getting video object reference and setting stream as `srcObject`.
Now, we are going to grab video stream using [getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia).
For this blog post purpose, we are not going to dig deep into constraints creation so we're just gonna use

```js
{
  video: true
}
```

which basically means, we just want to grab video stream.

Now it's time to create `VideoFeed` component and actually, request some streams.

```jsx {2,11-26}
export const VideoFeed = () => {
  const [stream, setStream] = useState(null)

  // we won't be using setConstraints but keeping this as state is needed
  // to actually be able get another stream, when conststrains change
  const [constraints, setConstraints] = useState({
    video: true,
  })

  // initialize streams
  useEffect(() => {
    const getMediaStream = async () => {
      try {
        const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(
          constraints
        )

        console.log("Setting stream", mediaStream)
        setStream(mediaStream)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
      }
    }

    getMediaStream()
  })

  return (
    <div className="video-feed">
      <Stream className="video-feed-stream" stream={stream} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Looks nice and clean. Unfortunately, when you try this you'll notice infinite loop of getting and setting the stream.
It's happening because we forgot to pass the second argument of `useEffect` hook.
As a result, the current flow is the following:

1. After calling `getUserMedia` the stream is set as a state which causes rerendering of the component
2. `useEffect` is rerun because we haven't specified any conditions for running it

So let's specify the conditions.

```jsx {26}
export const VideoFeed = () => {
  const [stream, setStream] = useState(null)

  // we won't be using setConstraints but keeping this as state is needed
  // to actually be able get another stream, when conststrains change
  const [constraints, setConstraints] = useState({
    video: true,
  })

  // initialize streams
  useEffect(() => {
    const getMediaStream = async () => {
      try {
        const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(
          constraints
        )

        console.log("Setting stream", mediaStream)
        setStream(mediaStream)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
      }
    }

    getMediaStream()
  }, [constraints])

  return (
    <div className="video-feed">
      <Stream className="video-feed-stream" stream={stream} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now it works. Well, kind of. You'll notice your camera is still on, even after navigating out of the page.
Whenever the stream is obtained using `getUserMedia` it has to be stopped when it's no longer needed. To fix that,
we need to use another effect, which will clean up the stream when the component is unmounted. 

```jsx {29-42}
export const VideoFeed = () => {
  const [stream, setStream] = useState(null)

  // we won't be using setConstraints but keeping this as state is needed
  // to actually be able get another stream, when conststrains change
  const [constraints, setConstraints] = useState({
    video: true,
  })

  // initialize streams
  useEffect(() => {
    const getMediaStream = async () => {
      try {
        const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(
          constraints
        )

        console.log("Setting stream", mediaStream)
        setStream(mediaStream)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
      }
    }

    getMediaStream()
  }, [constraints])

  // cleanup streams
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (!stream) {
        return
      }

      console.log("Cleaning up stream.", stream)

      const tracks = stream.getTracks()
      tracks.forEach(track => {
        track.stop()
      })
    }
  }, [stream])

  return (
    <div className="video-feed">
      <Stream className="video-feed-stream" stream={stream} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The effect, we've just added, will be run only when the stream's changed.
At this point, our component starts to be a bit too complex.
On the other hand, obtaining a stream and performing a cleanup looks like a perfect piece of code to extract as a custom hook.
Custom hooks are just pure JavaScript functions which allow reusing stateful logic. We can just grab every single line related to this and extract a function - `useMediaStream`.

```js {43}
import { useState, useEffect } from "react"

export const useMediaStream = constraints => {
  const [stream, setStream] = useState(null)

  // initialize streams
  useEffect(() => {
    const getMediaStream = async () => {
      try {
        const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(
          constraints
        )

        console.log("Stream fetched", mediaStream)
        setStream(mediaStream)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
      }
    }

    if (!constraints) {
      console.log("Constraints not provided, the stream will not be fetched.")
      return
    }

    getMediaStream()
  }, [constraints])

  // cleanup streams
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (stream) {
        const tracks = stream.getTracks()
        tracks.forEach(track => {
          track.stop()
        })

        return
      }
    }
  }, [stream])

  return stream
}
```

Now, we can use our custom hook to make our component much smaller.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"

import { Stream } from "./Stream"
import { useMediaStream } from "../../media/useMediaStream"

export const VideoFeed = () => {
  const [constraints, setConstraints] = useState({
    video: true,
  })

  const stream = useMediaStream(constraints)

  return (
    <div className="video-feed">
      <Stream className="video-feed-stream" stream={stream} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

That's it, we have a nice reusable hook. If you're interested in the more in-depth description of creating custom React Hooks check out the following
